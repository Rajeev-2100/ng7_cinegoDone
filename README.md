It’s a collection of 4 bite-sized tools designed to add cinema detail, date of lauching and review it the movie.


🧰 Tech Stack:
 HTML5 | PicoCSS | JavaScript
Each tool has its own page, connected through a simple navbar. It was a great learning experience in routes, api handling, form handling, calculations, and writing event-driven logic using function programming.

This project was built as a learning milestone in neoG Camp, and I’m incredibly grateful for the mentorship and guidance of Ankita Tripathi🙌. Thank you for helping me level up!

It's a reminder that even small, simple tools can solve real-life problems. Try making something useful and have fun doing it!
